## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Although I believe I could have done better on this challenge, it was a good experience considering that this was the first time I've used styled components. Next time, I'll maybe use a different approach when it comes to styling.

I'd say that the most challenging thing was thinking about how to create a good folder structure for future projects and deciding what technologies would be nice to use, considering that the repository will hold many other different challenges.

I'm open to any feedback or help, and I'd be happy to know everything I need to improve so I can become a better developer.
